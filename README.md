Seven types of spatial sound stimuli, correspondingto seven horizontal spatial positions — coded accordingly: 
9: 90º, 10: 60º, 11: 30º to the left of participant, 
one in front — 12: 0º,
and 1: 30º, 2: 60º, 3: 90º to the right, 
each in 3 pitch variants: u: 621.127 Hz (half an octave up), 441.000 Hz (standard), and d: 312.766 Hz (half 
an octave down), so the pitch differences were easily and naturally detectable by the participants.
